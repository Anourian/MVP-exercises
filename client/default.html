<div class="alert alert-info">
  What is Gomoku? Essentially it is very similar to tic tac toe in that players are to place 5 pieces in a row to win. However, the board it is played on is generally larger and there are optional rules to make things interesting.

  The version on this site is a simple immitation of the concept without any optional features.
